## Sal Zaydon's Capstone ##

This is the live repository of my SUNYIT/SUNY Poly Capstone project. The final goal that I hope to achieve is create a place where Boy Scout Troops can track the advancement of their scouts, as well as the contact information of all the members of a specific troop. 

All information that is in the database is generated, so don't think you are stealing any information of youths.

## Server Reqs. ##
I will be using a server that runs Apache 2.2.15, along with MySQL 5.5.41 running on a CentOS 6.5 Virtual Machine. I don't foresee there being anything specific for Apache or MySQL, so if you feel like you want to use any replacements of those go right ahead.

This is a working project, so things will be changing hopefully daily. So if you do any pulls and something is broken, send me some sort of communication and it will most likely be fixed in my next sync with the magical GitHub
