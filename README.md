## Sal Zaydon's Capstone ##

This is the live repository of my SUNYIT/SUNY Poly Capstone project. The final goal that I hope to achieve is create a place where Boy Scout Troops can track the advancement of their scouts, as well as the contact information of all the members of a specific troop. 

All information that is in the database is generated, so don't think you are stealing any information of youths.

This is a working project, so things will be changing hopefully daily. So if you do any pulls and something is broken, send me some sort of communication and it will most likely be fixed in my next sync with the magical GitHub
